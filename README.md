This Python program implements a facial recognition-based student attendance system. 
It allows users to register student images via webcam, trains a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model on the collected data, and recognizes faces in real-time to determine student presence. 
It uses OpenCV for image capture, processing, and face detection.
